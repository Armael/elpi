## Version 1.1.2 (December 2018)

Builtin:
 - `name` is now typed as `any -> variadic any prop` to support the following
   two use cases:
   + `name T` succeeds if `T` is an eigenvariable (even if it is applied)
   + `name T HD ARGS` succeeds if `T` is an eigenvariable an decomposes it
     to its head symbol and its arguments as a list:
     `pi f x y\ name (f x y) f [x,y]`

## Version 1.1 (September 2018)

Language:
 - CHR semantics conformed to the "revised operational semantics", that is
   roughly the following:
   - 1 for each active constraint (just declared via declare_constraint)
     - 2 for each rule
       - 3 for each position j of the active constraint (from 0 to n)
         - 4 for each permutation of constraints having the active at j
           - 5 try apply the rule
             - 6 remove constraints to be removed from
                 the current set of permutations and the set of
                 active or passive constraints
                 
   In Elpi 1.0 loops 3 and 2 were swapped (by mistake)
   
 - CHR keys refined. In `declare_constraints C KEYS`:
   + `KEYS` must be a list of variables (no more special case `KEYS = Var`)
   + `KEYS` = `[_,...]` labels the constraint with the unique variable `_`.
     In other words `_` is a master key one can use to label constraints
     that share no other variable and that have to be combined together.
     The master key will never be assigned, hence it does not count for
     resumption
   + `KEYS` = `[]` is accepted with the following meaning: constraints with
     no key are never resumed automatically and are never combined with other
     constraints

Builtin:
 - `halt` is now typed as `variadic string prop` and the strings passed
   are printed when the interpreter halts

Aesthetic:
 - bound variables are now printed as `c0, c1, ...` instead of `x0, x1, ...`
   to avoid ambiguity with `X0, X1, ...` on small/far-away screens

API changes:
 - rename:
   + `custom_constraints` -> `state` (record field)
   + `syntactic_constraints` -> `constraints` (type)
   + `CustomConstraint` -> `CustomState` (module)
 - add:
   + `StrMap` and `StrSet`: expose `pp` and `show`
 - alias:
   + `Data.Extend.solution` ~ `Data.solution` (cast: `Data.Extend.of_solution`)

Compilation:
 - require re >= 1.7.2 (the version introducing `Re_str` -> `Re.str`)

Misc:
 - improved some error messages, minor fixes to elpi-checker

## Version 1.0 (April 2018)
Second public release, developed in tandem with coq-elpi and matita-elpi.

The programming language features syntactic constraints (suspended goals) and
a meta language (inspired by CHR) to manipulate the constrain store.

There is an API for clients letting one drive the interpreter and
extend the set of built-in predicates, register quotations and
anti-quotations, etc.

The software is now built using findlib into a library.
The standalone interpreter is just a regular client of the API.
